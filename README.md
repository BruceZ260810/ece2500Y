1. **Read the CSV Files**: Load both CSV files using a library like pandas, which allows you to work with data easily.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the data is clean, i.e., there are no missing values, and that the values are in the correct format (numerical).

3. **Alignment of Time Frames**: Make sure both CSV files cover the same time frames if the comparison is time-dependent.

4. **Direct Comparison**: For each time step, calculate the difference between the corresponding `x`, `y`, and `likelihood` values for each joint. You can simply subtract one set of coordinates from the other to get the direct difference.

5. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate statistical measures such as mean difference, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum differences.

6. **Error Metrics**: Use error metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to quantify the differences in the coordinates.

7. **Threshold Analysis**: You might want to define a threshold to decide whether the differences are significant or not.

8. **Visualization**: Plot the differences using graphs, which can give you a visual sense of the variation over time.

9. **Consistency Check for Likelihood**: You may also want to compare the `likelihood` values to check the consistency of the readings.

10. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate the correlation between the different sets of coordinates to see how closely they vary with each other.
